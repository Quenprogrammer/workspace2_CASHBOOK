      title: 'Deposit (25%)',
      description: 'The deposit is the initial amount paid upfront by the buyer, typically expressed as a percentage of the property price. A higher deposit reduces the amount borrowed, leading to lower monthly payments and potentially better mortgage terms. Most lenders require a minimum deposit to approve a loan.',

      title: 'Loan Amount',
      description: 'The loan amount is the principal borrowed from the bank or financial institution after deducting the deposit from the property price. This amount will be repaid over the agreed amortization period along with interest. Lenders evaluate a buyerâ€™s creditworthiness before approving this amount.',

      title: 'Interest Rate',
      description: 'The interest rate is the percentage charged annually by the lender on the remaining loan balance. It can be fixed (remains constant throughout the loan term) or variable (fluctuates based on market conditions). The interest rate significantly impacts the total cost of borrowing over time.',
      importance: 'Affects overall borrowing cost and monthly payment.',

      title: 'Amortization Period',
      description: 'The amortization period is the total time over which the loan is scheduled to be repaid in full. Longer periods result in lower monthly payments but higher overall interest paid. Shorter periods increase monthly payments but reduce total interest costs, leading to faster debt repayment.',

      importance: 'Shows the long-term cost of borrowing.',

      title: 'Monthly Mortgage Insurance (if applicable)',
      description: 'Some lenders require mortgage insurance if the deposit is below a certain threshold (typically 20%). This protects the lender in case of default and adds to the monthly costs. It may be removed once a certain equity percentage is reached.',
